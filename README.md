# Santander Product Recommendation Kaggle Challenge
## Final Project for CSCI349 - Professor Brian King
## Team members: Tung Phan & Son Pham

### Refer to folder Submission for our exported HTML workbooks/reports.

* PaperPhaseI_ReformatData.html
* PaperPhaseII_DataExploration.html
* PaperFinal_PredictionModel.html

The 3 main workbooks that we used are in the main folder space (Run .ipynb with Python Jupyter, and .Rmd with R):

* Phase 1: ReformatData.ipynb
* Phase 2: DataExploration_processed.ipynb
* Phase 3: PredictionModel.Rmd

Folder Data is intentionally not included in the repo due to its size. Since this is a public competition, the datasets that we used can be easily retrieved from 

### Sample run

Since the main notebook is fairly hard to run and the original data is also very big and inconvenient to process, we also include a ```Sample Run```. The Sample Run contains processed data frames and focus on actually getting XGBoost model to run. Simply run the R Markdown notebook inside the Sample Run folder to execute and see the results.
